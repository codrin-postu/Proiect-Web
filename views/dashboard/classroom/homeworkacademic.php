                <h3>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h3>
                <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem
                    Ipsum has
                    been
                    the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley
                    of
                    type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
                    also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised
                    in
                    the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently
                    with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

                <h3> Why do we use it?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a
                    page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
                    normal
                    distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like
                    readable
                    English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their
                    default
                    model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
                    Various
                    versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected
                    humour
                    and the like).</p>
